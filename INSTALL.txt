Purge


Supported platforms and integrations:
Reverse proxy caches: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy)
- Purge supports Varnish (recommended), Squid or Nginx.
- Varnish needs a modification to its configuration file. See this section in the
Varnish section in the Drupal handbook: http://drupal.org/node/1054886#purge
- Squid needs to have purging enabled in its configuration. See
http://docstore.mik.ua/squid/FAQ-7.html#ss7.5
- Nginx needs an extra module and configuration. See 
http://labs.frickle.com/nginx_ngx_cache_purge/ and the installation hints below.
Also see this issue http://drupal.org/node/1048000 for more background info

Installation:
- Unpack, place just like any other module.
- Enable Purge and Purge UI modules
- Navigate to Administration -> Configuration -> System -> Purge
- Set your Varnish or Squid proxy url(s) like "http://localhost" or
"http://192.168.1.23:8080 http://192.168.2.34:8080" for multiple hosts.
- If your using nginx you need to specify the purge path and the get method in
your proxy setting like this:
"http://192.168.1.76:8080/purge?purge_method=get"
